#### Introduction:
This project was created to demonstrated the exploration into the developement of machine learning models capable of predicting groups of women at risk geographically and provide an increased awareness of crime in America. The three parameters that are being examined within the data set collected from the NYPD and the NCVS are crime type, age and location of each of female victims within these regions.
