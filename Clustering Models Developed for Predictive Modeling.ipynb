    "## Introduction:\n",
    "This section demonstrates the use of two clustering algorythms, K-Means and DBSCAN, on Crime Victim Data gathered from the NYPD and the NCVS Dashboard. The objective is to determine which model is the most successful at predictive clustering using both data sets, and then beginning a process of incremental learning. By taking the model trained on the NCVS data and fitting NYPD data, it is possible to exicute a process known as incremental learning. As crime data is extremily complex utilizing incremental learning will address inconcistencies that are common with crime data. \n",

    "# Pre-Processing:\n",
    "All of the data within these crime sets is catagorical in nature and as a result was proceed differently. Part of pre-processing was grouping crime types together, as well as removing those which didn't apply to specific models. When addressing the grouping of data within the NYPD dataset, crimes were coordinated based on the general type of crime and severity. The grouping of key codes is explained in the following table, along with thier offense description. The data pulled from the NCVS pertains to mainly Personal Crimes, such as sexual assault, robbery, aggrivated assault and simple assault. In order to make the data found within the NYPD data to be compatible with the incremental learning to occur, these crimes were once again grouped and sorted based on the types found in the NCVS data. Data pertaining to age groups has already been seperated, with an adjustment made to the NCVS data to group minors together as that data in particular breaks the age groups apart indepth. \n",
