"Estimate flag of 1: Interpret data with caution, based on 10 or fewer sample cases or the coefficient of variation is greater than 50%."
"Estimate flag of 2: For numbers, indicates estimate is equal to 0 victimizations. For rates, indicates estimate rounds to less than .05 victimizations per 1,000. For percents, indicates estimate rounds to less than .5 percent."
"Estimates for 2006 should not be compared to other years. See https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/methodology#dataComp for more information."
"In October 2018, BJS released a revised set of 2016 NCVS data. See https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/methodology#dataComp for more information."
"One limitation of the 2016 NCVS revised data file relates to youth 12-17 years old. A significant portion of youth crime occurs at school and therefore, an inherent limitation of the file is that the youth in the sample had less time in school based on the cases that were pulled for the revised file. Please use caution when examining crime estimates for youth using 2016 data."
"Income was imputed beginning in 2015, so no cases in 2015 or later have unknown income. See Terms and Definitions for more information."
