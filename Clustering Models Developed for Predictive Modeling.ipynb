    "## Introduction:\n",
    "This section demonstrates the use of two clustering algorythms, K-Means and DBSCAN, on Crime Victim Data gathered from the NYPD and the NCVS Dashboard. The objective is to determine which model is the most successful at predictive clustering using both data sets, and then beginning a process of incremental learning. By taking the model trained on the NCVS data and fitting NYPD data, it is possible to exicute a process known as incremental learning. As crime data is extremily complex utilizing incremental learning will address inconcistencies that are common with crime data. \n",

    "# Pre-Processing:\n",
    "All of the data within these crime sets is catagorical in nature and as a result was proceed differently. Part of pre-processing was grouping crime types together, as well as removing those which didn't apply to specific models. When addressing the grouping of data within the NYPD dataset, crimes were coordinated based on the general type of crime and severity. The grouping of key codes is explained in the following table, along with thier offense description. The data pulled from the NCVS pertains to mainly Personal Crimes, such as sexual assault, robbery, aggrivated assault and simple assault. In order to make the data found within the NYPD data to be compatible with the incremental learning to occur, these crimes were once again grouped and sorted based on the types found in the NCVS data. Data pertaining to age groups has already been seperated, with an adjustment made to the NCVS data to group minors together as that data in particular breaks the age groups apart indepth. All null values found within the NYPD data for age have been removed, it was included within analysis to visualize the amount of known data in comparison to the unknown within the filtered set.\n",

    "Data pertaining to Public or Society Crimes, such as driving under the influence, traffic violations, child abandonment, pocession of a deadly weapon or drug pocessions have been removed from this data. This was done as the NCVS data pulled only pertains to Personal Crimes. This data was utilized both through the initial run of the models and again when being fitted to the selected NCVS model. The only difference is that when the NYPD data was fitted to the NCVS model the NCIC model was used. This was to demonstrate the differences between the sets as a whole. \n",

    "## K-Means Model:\n",
    "There are a number of clustering models used for data anlysis, one of these models is the kmeans model. The objective of the model is to assign data points to clusters, based on proximity to a centroid. By doing so it explores the association between data points based on distance calculations between groups. The model opperates under the assumption that the cluster is spherical in nature, equally size and has similar dencities. Analysizing crime statistics as well as conceptualizing the actual precence of crime in US society, clustering is often used. The reason is that crime classifications are based on a group of characteristics that are requried for a crime to be considered one class or another. As this data is based on catagorical structure, as opposed to an interval clustering is possible. It is important to note that while in the case of crime, is that while Offenses do carry an ordinal weight within socity, this weight is difficult to build into a model without adding an extra layer or catagory. \n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means has limitations, as it performs poorly when clusters are irregular in size, shape and decnity. As the alogrythem itself is based on distance calculations from a centroid, it can be sensitive to the initial placement of a cluster, and even interpret outliers with greater impact than necessary. This is why the analysis begins with K-Means but has an added layer with DBSCAN. "
